<h1>- Programming -</h1>
<p>My schooling at Coleman University has taught me how to understand programming with C++/C#. I now am trying Ruby/Rails, since I would love to create web apps that are flexible to work with both on the computer and mobile devices. I have a great understanding of programming and OOP, so it's fairly easy to understand other programming languages with ease. Just a difference in syntax, and advantages/disadvantages. :)</p>
